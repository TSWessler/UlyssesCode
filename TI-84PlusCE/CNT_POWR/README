This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

Ulysses likes to count by 0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ... and 0^3, 1^3, 2^3, 3^3, ... etc.

This code does just that: the user puts in the power and it counts n^power where n=0,1,2,...

Ex. 0,1,4,9,16,...


The output displays the number of numbers that have been counted/displayed (on the left) and the value of the nth number counted (on the right)
Ex:
0: val_{0}
1: val_{1}
2: val_{2}
3: val_{3}
.
.
.
n: val_{n}

And terminates when n exceeds some hard-coded value or val_{n} exceeds an input value.


To run:
1. At prompt "Enter power value:" enter the value of the power then press Enter.
2. At prompt "Enter max value:" enter the max value then press Enter.
3. Press Enter when prompted.


Example 1:

Enter power value:
3
Enter max value:
1000

0: 0.0
1: 1.0
2: 8.0
3: 27.0
4: 64.0
5: 125.0
6: 216.0
7: 343.0
8: 512.0
9: 729.0
10: 1000.0
Done!
Try again sometime!




NOTES:

It does do fractional and negative powers with 0^power (power<=0 undefined), but, in this version it doesn't have a minimum value so will run until the max number of numbers is reached.

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts 0^power, 1^power, 2^power, 3^power, ...

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *power
            *max_value
        Output:
            0: 0^power
            1: 1^power
            2: 2^power
            .
            .
            .
            i: i^power

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or i^power>=max_value
