    changes:
        *cosmetic changes to be more consistent with other scripts

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts by 2^n, but first says the number then flips the last 2 digits of the number and says it again.
    *Ulee named this "counting by [I forget--I'll have to look up]" but we're calling it "count by flip-the-end"

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *max_value
        Output:
            0: 0
            1: 2
            2: 4
            .
            .
            .
            i: j

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or j>=max_value

NOTES:

because this is exponential, it gets big very fast.

this concept (switching the last 2 digits) can be used for other counting methods (other than 2^n), but Ulee did it with 2^n when making it up, so that's what this script is based on. Obviously, the algorithm can easily be repurposed for other counting methods.
