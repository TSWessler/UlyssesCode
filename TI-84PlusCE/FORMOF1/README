This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

This program determines which form of 1 a whole fraction is. That is, for some n in base-(k+1), it determines whether n/n=1.00000... or n/n=0.kkkkk...

Notice: 1.00000... and 0.kkkkk... are EXACTLY equal to each other (e.g., 1.0000... is exactly equal to 0.99999... in base-10), so we are just determining which form of "1" the whole fraction is.

Note: The way that we define n/n is by counting n (1/n)-ths. This is equivalent to adding (n-1)/n and 1/n. If 1/n + (n-1)/n = 1.00000..., then we say that this "form of 1" is "1.00000..."; if 1/n + (n-1)/n = 0.kkkkk..., then we say that this "form of 1" is "0.kkkkk...".

Note: the basis for this is Claim 1.
Claim 1: 1/n + (n-1)/n = 1.00000... in base-(k+1) if and only if ALL prime factors of n are also prime factors of (k+1); otherwise, 1/n + (n-1)/n = 0.kkkkk... (rationale in NOTES below).

Ex: 3/3 in base-10 is 0.9999999999... because:
1/3 = 0.3333333333...
2/3 = 0.6666666666...
3/3 = 0.9999999999...

Ex: 7/7 in base-10 is 0.9999999999... because:
1/7 = 0.142857142857142857...
6/7 = 0.857142857142857142...
7/7 = 0.999999999999999999...


The output displays the form of 1 that 1/n + (n-1)/n = n/n is in base-(k+1)--either 1.00000... or 0.kkkkk...
Ex:
2/2 in base-10 is: 1.00000...
3/3 in base-10 is: 0.99999...
3/3 in base-9 is: 1.00000...
3/3 in base-8 is: 0.77777...





To run:
1. At prompt "Enter value for numerator/denominator:" enter the value counting will start at then press Enter.
2. At prompt "Enter base value:" enter the max value to count to then press Enter.
3. Press Enter when prompted.


Example 1:

Enter value for numerator/denominator:
3
Enter base value:
8

3/3 in base-8 is:
0.77777777777777777777...

Try again sometime!







NOTES:


The rationale for Claim 1:
Let's look at the example n/n in base-(k+1), and use the term "decimal place" to be generalized, not just base-10. In a number D=...(D2)(D1).(d1)(d2)(d3)..., the first decimal place d1 is how many whole 1/(k+1) there are leftover after subtracting D and ...(D2)(D1), where d1<(k+1). Similarly, the second decimal place is how many 1/(k+1)^2 is leftover after subtracting D and (D2)(D1).(d1). Following this pattern, we see that unless prime multiples of D are also multiples of (k+1), then there will always be non-zero leftovers when subtracting 1/(k+1)^integer.

        *consolidation edits

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *adds 1/n + (n-1)/n in infinite decimals in base-(k+1) to determine the form of "1"--either 1.00000... or 0.kkkkk...
        *note that 1.00000... = 0.kkkkk... EXACTLY, so this program is just determining which FORM n/n is in base-(k+1)

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *n_value
            *base_value
        Output:
            n_value/n_value in base-base_value is:
            1.00000000000000000000...
            --or--

for base-36 or lower the display is 0.KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK... while for higher bases it's 0.(k)(k)(k)(k)(k)(k)...
where K is the base-36 character, compared to (k) which is the base-10 digit

the order of digits is:
