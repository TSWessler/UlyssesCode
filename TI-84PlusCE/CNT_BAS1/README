This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

Ulysses kept asking me how to count by base-1, and I told him that we couldn't, and he kept asking why. I came up with a way to do it.

Counting by base-1 is basically making tally marks. But, I told Ulysses the rule that for base-n we don't say the number n, so in base-1 we don't say the number 1. So, all we have are 0's.

If we are using only 0's, and in a tally mark kind of way, then "0" means 1, "00" means 2, "000" means 3, and so on.

That means that "0" can't represent 0, and instead a blank space means 0 (similar to no tally marks). But, we can instead use "+0" to make +1 and "-0" to make -1, so "+" or "-" can be used to make 0.

This is how we count in base-1.


However, Ulysses also likes counting aloud, so rather than saying "zero, zero zero, zero zero zero, ...," we can find similar patterns of "four, forty-four, four hundred and forty four, ...," which led me to say "zero, zeroty-zero, zero hundred and zeroty-zero, ..."

Ulysses is obsessed with prefixes (nano, micro, milli, deca, kilo, mega, etc.) as well as names of large numbers (thousand, million, billion, trillion, etc.), so I saw this as an opportunity to put a bunch of large numbers, so he can currently go as high as 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (so the unquadragintillions).


The output displays the number of numbers that have been counted/displayed (on the left) and the value of the nth number counted (on the right), followed by how to say the last number out loud.
Ex:
0: +
1: +0
2: +00
.
.
.
n: val_{n}

And terminates when the input value is reached, then says the name of the nth number.



To run:
1. At prompt "Enter how many numbers to count:" enter the number of numbers to count then press Enter.
2. Press Enter when prompted.


Example 1:

Enter how many numbers to count:
9
0: +
1: +0
2: +00
3: +000
4: +0000
5: +00000
6: +000000
7: +0000000
8: +00000000
9: +000000000
zero hundred and zeroty zero million
zero hundred and zeroty zero thousand
zero hundred and zeroty zero
Try again sometime!

    changes:
        *added max_count_with_pauses
        *cosmetic changes to be more consistent with other scripts

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts in "base 1" up to a max number of numbers
    *gives the number and then text for saying the number aloud

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *max_number_of_numbers
        Output:
            0: +
            1: +0
            2: +00
            .

            .
            i: j

            output_string

            it ends when i==max_number_of_numbers, then outputs how the last number is said aloud

I kind of want to add commas to "display_string" in "count_numbers" but haven't yet
