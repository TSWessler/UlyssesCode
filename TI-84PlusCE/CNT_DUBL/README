This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

This is the first program that Ulee asked me to write after trying out the programs I initially put on his calculator. It is simple: it just displays 2^n for all n=0,1,2,... until 2^n >= some max value that was input.


The output displays the number of numbers that have been counted/displayed (on the left) and the value of the nth number counted (on the right)
Ex:
0: 1
1: 2
2: 4
3: 8
.
.
.
n: 2^n

And terminates when n exceeds some hard-coded value or 2^n exceeds an input value.


To run:
1. At prompt "Enter max value:" enter the value counting will start at then press Enter.
2. Press Enter when prompted.


Example 1:

Enter max value:
1000

0: 1
1: 2
2: 4
3: 8
4: 16
5: 32
6: 64
7: 128
8: 256
9: 512
10: 1024
Done!
Try again sometime!

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ...

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *max_value
        Output:
            0: 2^0
            1: 2^1
            2: 2^2
            .
            .
            .
            i: 2^i

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or 2^i>=max_value
