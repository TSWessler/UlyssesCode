This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

All it does is sees if one number (number to count to) divides another number (number counting by). Ulee wanted a program of this name to fit with the other program names (***_TYP and SKIP_***), and he also wanted a program with frowning faces, so he made up this program for me to put on his calculator.


To run:
1. At prompt "Enter number counting by:" enter number to count by then press Enter.
2. At prompt "Enter number to count to:" enter number to count to then press Enter.


Example 1:
Enter number counting by:
0.15
Enter number to count to:
1
:(
Sorry! Cannot type a number to count to that is not divisible by the number counting by!
:(
Try again sometime!


Example 2:
Enter number counting by:
0.15
Enter number to count to:
1.5
:)
Good job typing numbers divisible by each other!
:)
Try again sometime!
