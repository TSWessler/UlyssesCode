This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

This is one of the main programs for Ulysses and his therapists/teachers. Ulysses likes to count by intervals beginning at various starting values. Ex. "Count by 1.9's starting at 0.9--0.9, 2.8, 4.7, ..."


The output displays the number of numbers that have been counted/displayed (on the left) and the value of the nth number counted (on the right)
Ex:
1: val_{1}
2: val_{2}
3: val_{3}
.
.
.
n: val_{n}

And terminates when n exceeds some hard-coded value or val_{n} exceeds an input value.


To run:
1. At prompt "Enter number counting by:" enter the number counting by then press Enter.
2. At prompt "Enter starting number:" enter the number starting at then press Enter.
3. At prompt "Enter max value to count to:" enter the max number to count to then press Enter.
4. Press Enter when prompted.


Example 1:

Enter number counting by:
1.9
Enter starting number:
.9
Enter max value to count to:
19.9

0: 0.9
1: 2.8
2: 4.7
3: 6.6
4: 8.5
5: 10.4
6: 12.3
7: 14.2
8: 16.1
9: 18.0
10: 19.9
Done!
Try again sometime!


Example 2:

Enter number counting by:
.155555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555
Enter starting number:
0
Enter max value to count to:
1.55555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555

0: 0.0

7: 1.08888888888888896
8: 1.24444444444444448
9: 1.39999999999999984
10: 1.55555555555555520
11: 1.71111111111111072

NOTES:

Can only input decimal values, not fractions or other functions. So, if you want to count by something like 1/7, must enter decimal approximation.

If you try Ulee's current favorite number to count by, 14/90 (0.155555555555555555...), you can see that there are errors after several 15 or so decimal places due to floating point arithmetic.

    update to: 2024 November 8
    changes:
        *didn't change this script to make inputting more robust

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts from "start_value" until reaching (at least) "max_value" by repeatedly increasing by a value of "skip_value"
    *e.g.: start_value = 0; max_value = 15; skip_value = 2;
        goes: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *skip_value
            *start_value
            *max_value (value that counts to with skipping)
        Output:
            0: start_value
            1: 1*skip_value+start_value
            .
            .
            .
            i: i*skip_value+start_value

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or i*skip_value+start_value>=max_value
