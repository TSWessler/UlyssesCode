    changes:
        *cosmetic changes to be more consistent with other scripts

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts from "start_value" until reaching (at least) "max_value" while skipping "skip_value"-1 numbers inbetween
    *e.g.: start_value = 0; max_value = 15; skip_value = 2;
        goes: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *skip_value
            *start_value
            *max_value (value that counts to with skipping)
        Output:
            0: start_value
            1: 1*skip_value+start_value
            .
            .
            .
            i: j*skip_value+start_value

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or j*skip_value+start_value>=max_value
