    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *base_value (must be between 2 and 36--see CNT_BAS1.py for base-1)
            *max_value (value in base that counts to--e.g., in base 2 max_value=2 displays 0,1,10 then stops)
        Output:
            0: 0
            1: 1

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or j>=max_value
