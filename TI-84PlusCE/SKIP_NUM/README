This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

This code is to answer Ulee's question of "If you're counting by X starting at Y, do you say Z?" Ex. If you're counting by 2's starting at 2, do you say the number 10? Yes: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.


To run:
1. At prompt "Enter number counting by:" enter the number counting by then press Enter.
2. At prompt "Enter starting number:" enter the number starting at then press Enter.
3. At prompt "Enter number you're wondering if you say while counting by [skip_value] starting at [start_value]:" enter the target number then press Enter.


Example 1:

Enter number counting by:
.15
Enter starting number:
0
Enter number you're wondering if you say while counting by .15 starting at 0.0:
1

NO :(
You do NOT say the number 1.0 while counting by 0.15 starting at 0.0
Try again sometime!


Example 2:

Enter number counting by:
.15
Enter starting number:
0
Enter number you're wondering if you say while counting by .15 starting at 0.0:
1.5

YES!
You do say the number 1.5 while counting by 0.15 starting at 0.0
Try again sometime!

        *made sure can't try counting by 0's

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *checks to see if a number is said if counting by some other number.
        Ex: Is 7.5 said while counting by 1.5 starting at 0?
            0,1.5,3,4.5,6,7.5--YES! 7.5 is said while counting by 1.5 starting at 0

Inputs:

    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *skip_value
            *start_value
            *target_value
        Output:
            [either "YES!" or "NO :("]
            You do say the number
            [target_value]
            while counting by
            [skip_value]
            starting at
            [start_value]
