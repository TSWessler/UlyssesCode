This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

This is a counting that Ulee made up (and I helped finalize the rules for). In counting by base-n, I said that we don't say the number n or any numbers above it. Ex. In base-3 we don't say 3 or any digits above it, so 0,1,2,10,11,12,20,21,22,100,101,...

In n-base, we don't say the number n or any numbers below it (except 0). Ex. 3-base is: 4,5,6,7,8,9,40,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,54,...

Notice that 0-base is regular counting and 8-base is the highest we can do (in a regular base-10 system).


The output displays the number of numbers that have been counted/displayed (on the left) and the value of the nth number counted (on the right)
Ex:
0: val_{0}
1: val_{1}
2: val_{2}
3: val_{3}
.
.
.
n: val_{n}

And terminates when n exceeds some hard-coded value or val_{n} exceeds an input value.


To run:
1. At prompt "Enter base value:" enter the value counting will start at then press Enter.
2. At prompt "Enter max value:" enter the max value to count to then press Enter.
3. Press Enter when prompted.


Example 1:

Enter base value:
8
Enter max value:
1000

0: 0
1: 9
2: 90
3: 99
4. 900
5: 909
6: 990
7: 999
Done!
Try again sometime!

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts "n-base" which Ulee made up (and I helped finalize rules), which is kind of backwards of counting in "base-n"
    *Ex: 3-base skips all numbers with 3's, 2's, and 1's in them, so:
        4,5,6,7,8,9,40,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,54,55,56,57,58,59,...

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *base_value
            *max_value
        Output:
            0: 0
            1: ???
            2: ???
            .
            .
            .
            i: j

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or j>=max_value

NOTES:

*base can only be an integer between 0 and 8 (inclusive)
*base 0 is regular counting
