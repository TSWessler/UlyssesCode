        *cosmetic changes to be more consistent with other scripts

Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts "n-base" which Ulee made up (and I helped finalize rules), which is kind of backwards of counting in "base-n"
    *Ex: 3-base skips all numbers with 3's, 2's, and 1's in them, so:
        4,5,6,7,8,9,40,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,54,55,56,57,58,59,...

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *base_value
            *max_value
        Output:
            0: 0
            1: ???
            2: ???
            .
            .
            .
            i: j

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or j>=max_value

NOTES:

*base can only be an integer between 0 and 8 (inclusive)
*base 0 is regular counting
