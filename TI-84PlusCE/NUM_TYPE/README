Description:
    *designed to run on Ulee's TI-84 Plus CE
    *counts up but without repeating any non-zero digits
    *Ulee named this "counting by dees" but we're calling it "counting by no-repeats" or "counting by 0 repeats"

Inputs:
    *NOTHING
    *(does have user input values when prompted)

Outputs/does:

        Enter:
            *max_value
        Output:
            0: 0
            1: 1
            2: 2
            .
            .
            .
            i: j

            it ends when either i==max_number_of_numbers (hard-coded) or j>=max_value

NOTES:

these values get big fast--value is on the order of 10^(number_of_numbers/10)
