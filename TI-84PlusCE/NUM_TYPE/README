This code is was designed for Ulysses to run on his TI-84 Plus CE calculator.

Ulysses likes to classify things. Numbers are no different. This program has the following sets:
Natural
Whole
Integer
Rational/Irrational
Real/Imaginary
Complex


To run:
1. At prompt:
	Enter "number" to classify:
	Note: "j" is for imaginary part
   Enter a number (where Python treats "j" as the imaginary unit)
2. Press "Enter" after each question to see whether or not the number is a member of that set


Example 1:
Enter "number" to classify:
Note: "j" is for imaginary part
0 [ENTER]
Is 0 a Complex Number?
[ENTER]
It is a complex number!
Is 0 Real or Imaginary?
[ENTER]
Real!
Is 0 Rational or Irrational?
[ENTER]
Rational!
...at least according to computers
Is 0 an Integer?
[ENTER]
YES!
Is 0 a Whole Number?
[ENTER]
YES!
Is 0 a Natural Number?
[ENTER]
NO :(
Try again sometime!








NOTES:

* This actually can't find any complex numbers, because any irrational number becomes the computer representation, which is rational.
* Another addition could be adding a list of acceptable (non-comprehensive) irrational numbers.
* If it DID have irrational numbers, Ulee would definitely appreciate categorizing as algebraic or transcendental.
* A good future improvement Ulee would like: Categorize complex numbers as rational/integer etc. complex numbers, not just subset of reals.
