Code for questions from an autistic kid's curious mind


I have a kid on the autism spectrum. He loves patterns and math, and when he gets obsessed with something he demands more and more examples of his obsession. These are programs to answer the questions he’s asked over and over and over again. Many of them are ready to be put into a TI-84 CE calculator, which we have done in order to aid his teachers and therapists.


Some topics he’s been into:

Color Mixing:

Ulysses was obsessed with what color is produced when two colors are mixed. He memorized the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary colors and which combinations are mixed to produce each one. However, it became too difficult for us to answer more complicated mixtures (or for us to memorize the color names and components). To help with this, I've made two aids over the years (which are currently a little bit in conflict with each other): A website to mix the colors and provide the names and components of a mixture, and an outdated model to try doing the same thing by mapping RYB mixtures (more appropriately GYB+Black+White) to RGB and using a lookup table. Eventually, I'd like to update this code because it was cool and does a better job handling brightness.


Counting:

This is one of the most persistent interests of Ulee's. Since he was 4, I'd use counting to help him calm down. He or I would count by intervals, or in different bases, or by some pattern that he'd make. I'd _try_ counting to help him go to sleep: he'd actually lie down to listen, but he was too engrossed to fall asleep--getting excited when I get from 333 to 1,000 in base-4, or when I make a mistake and he gets to laugh and ask "Dad, why did you say 334?!?"

These scripts are in python designed for use on Ulee's TI-84 CE calculator. They are things that he'd ask me over and over and over and over again. Luckily, his therapists spent their time becoming experts to help people like him rather than number theory, so these can serve as aids for them if they care to answer some of his "what comes after ___?" questions. Unfortuneately, I've forgotten most of his "count by ***" patterns.
